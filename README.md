hubot-schedule is a message scheduler runs on hubot.

It allows you to schedule a message in both `cron-style` and `datetime-based` format pattern.
It is for time-based scheduling, not interval-based scheduling.

Since hubot-schedule uses node-schedule to manage schedule, some of the cron features are not supported.
Please see [node-schedule](https://github.com/mattpat/node-schedule) for more details.

This script is greatly inspired by [hubot-cron](https://github.com/miyagawa/hubot-cron).
At first, I wanted a datetime-based scheduler.
As I start developing this, I noticed that node-schedule also suppports cron-style scheduling, so I changed my mind to develop a scheduler that supports both cron-style and datetime-based format.

`v4.2.1` sometimes fails to add new schedule.

Hubot> hubot schedule add "2015-01-16 10:00" Let's release this script!
6738: Schedule created

Hubot> hubot schedule add "0 10 * * 1-5" Don't forget to brew coffee :)
9735: Schedule created

Hubot> hubot schedule list
6738: [ 2015-01-16 10:00:00 +09:00 ] #Shell Let's release this script!
9735: [ 0 10 * * 1-5 ] #Shell Don't forget to brew coffee :)

Hubot> hubot schedule update 6738 Let's release this module and share with everyone!
6738: Scheduled message updated

Hubot> hubot schedule list
6738: [ 2015-01-16 10:00:00 +09:00 ] #Shell Let's release this script and share with everyone!
9735: [ 0 10 * * 1-5 ] #Shell Don't forget to brew coffee :)

Let's release this script and share with everyone!
(Hubot posts the message at 2015-01-16 10:00:00 and schedule will be removed automatically)

Hubot> hubot schedule del 9735
9735: Schedule canceled

Hubot> hubot schedule list
Message is not scheduled

Hubot> hubot schedule add "0 10 * * 1-5" hubot image me coffee
9735: Schedule created
(hubot can process messages sent by hubot-schedule, so you can ask hubot to do something at the scheduled time, like post an image of coffee.)
```

If you need to persist scheduled messages, use hubot-brain persistent module like [hubot-redis-brain](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-redis-brain).

### How to use UTC Offset

If OS timezone is set to Asia/Tokyo（UTC Offset would be "+09:00"）

```
Hubot> hubot schedule env
DEBUG = false
DONT_RECEIVE = false
DENY_EXTERNAL_CONTROL = false
LIST_REPLACE_TEXT = {"@":"[@]"}
DEFAULT_UTC_OFFSET_FOR_CRON = "+09:00"

Hubot> hubot schedule add "2019-08-05 10:00 +02:00" use UTC Offset for datetime-based format pattern
2914: Schedule created

Hubot> hubot schedule add "0 10 * * 1-5, +02:00" use UTC Offset for cron-style format pattern
4291: Schedule created

Hubot> hubot schedule list
2914: [ 2019-08-05 17:00:00 +09:00 ] #Shell use UTC Offset for datetime-based format pattern (listed schedules are shown using OS timezone)
4291: [ 0 10 * * 1-5, +02:00 ] #Shell use UTC Offset for cron-style format pattern
```

## Configuration

### HUBOT_SCHEDULE_DEBUG

Setting environment variable `HUBOT_SCHEDULE_DEBUG=1` will show some debug messages.

### HUBOT_SCHEDULE_DENY_EXTERNAL_CONTROL

Setting environment variable `HUBOT_SCHEDULE_DENY_EXTERNAL_CONTROL=1` will deny schedule control from other rooms.

### HUBOT_SCHEDULE_DONT_RECEIVE

Setting environment variable `HUBOT_SCHEDULE_DONT_RECEIVE=1` will disable hubot not to process messages sent by hubot-schedule.

### HUBOT_SCHEDULE_LIST_REPLACE_TEXT

Setting environment variable `HUBOT_SCHEDULE_LIST_REPLACE_TEXT='<stringified json>'` will configure the text replacement used when listing scheduled messages.
Default configuration is `'{"@":"[@]"}'`.

### HUBOT_SCHEDULE_UTC_OFFSET_FOR_CRON

Setting environment variable `HUBOT_SCHEDULE_UTC_OFFSET_FOR_CRON='<string format UTC Offset(e.g. "+09:00")>'` will set default UTC Offset for cron-style format pattern.
If not set, OS timezone's offset would be used.
